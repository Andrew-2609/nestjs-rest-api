### This project was made based on an [Alura](https://alura.com.br/)'s course.

It is a simple REST API with an in-memory array of Users, utilizing NestJS and TypeScript.

The main goal of this project was to learn some of the core features of [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), such as Filters, Interceptors, some specific Decorators and workorounds for some common problems.
